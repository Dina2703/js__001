    <h2>Asynchronous JS</h2>
    <h4>setTimeout() and setInterval()</h4>
    <p>
      Timers and Intervals are not part of JS itself. They are implemented by
      the browser and
      <span style="color: red">setTimeout() and setInterval()</span> are
      basically names give to that functionallity in JS
    </p>
    <h4>Callbacks</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Callbacks </strong> are functions passed as arguments to others
        functions. The function which accepts a function as an argument or
        returns a function is called <strong>a higher order function</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        They can be <strong>synchronous </strong> if they execute immediatly or
        they can be <strong>asynchronous </strong> where they get executed after
        some time has passed, some event has occured or some data has been
        fetched
      </li>
      <li>
        The phenomenon which happens when we
        <em>nest multiple callbacks within a function </em> is called
        <strong> a callback hell</strong>. It makes the code very difficult to
        understand and maintain.
      </li>
      <li>
        An alternative and the recommend approach now is to use
        <strong>Promises</strong>
      </li>
